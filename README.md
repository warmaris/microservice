# Microservice example

Work in progress

## What's this?

This project is my personal understanding of clean architecture. I made it to show, how you can:
- Organize your code by packets, layers, etc
- Build communication between microservices
- Improve fault tolerance (TBD)
- Make microservices observable (TBD)
